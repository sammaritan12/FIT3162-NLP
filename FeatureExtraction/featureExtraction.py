# Assumptions:
# - clean preprocessed data is a text file containing text only
# - extractionm will be done using NLTK

# TODO import text files

# TODO character n-gram feature extraction
# space free character 4-gram
# a)string of characters of length 4 that includes no spaces
# b) string of characters 4 or less surrounded by spaces


# TODO word n-gram feature extraction

# TODO punctuated feature extraction

# TODO average sentence length feature extraction
# this might be somewhat easy
# tokenize sentences, get average length (of whole piece or per amount of characters?)
