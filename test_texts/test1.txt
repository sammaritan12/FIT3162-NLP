Lizzie turned and looked at me and uttered a cry of fear, and began to
run. Her clothes had a strange rustle, and I could scarcely see her in
the darkness. She seemed to run up a stairway into the snowy air, and
was out of sight in a jiffy. Then I could hear her screaming to me in a
dark tree-top, as if she saw something terrible.
“Look out, Cricket! Look out! Look out!”
