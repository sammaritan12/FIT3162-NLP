Dwight did not answer at first. He looked somewhat ashamed. Presently,
however, he concluded, that it was best to be frank and honest; so he
looked up and acknowledged that it was so.
"Yes," said his mother; "and while you are under the influence of such a
prejudice, it would do no good for us to discuss the subject, for you
would not be convinced; so you had better give it up."
Madam Rachel saw, while she was speaking, that Dwight did not look
sullen and dissatisfied, but good-natured and pleasant; and so she knew
that he had concluded to listen, candidly, to what she had to say.
