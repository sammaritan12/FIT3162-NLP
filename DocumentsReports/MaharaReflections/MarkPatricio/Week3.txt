This week I worked on the classification as well as the feature extraction. It was a very long process trying to understand how the items fit in and worked together. I explained this with Amelia during the lab, trying to clarify anything that needed to be worked on.

Amelia showed me what she was up to with the preprocessing, hitting a few snags on the way. Overall however, I think that we have overcome the hard part - that is the lethargy to start the projecft due to the sheer amount of work percieived to be done.

Jojo was very helpful with regards to what to do with NLTK, as well as the features that need to be extracted. She also mentioned that sci-kit learn and the machine learning steps that should also be considered, we took this into consideration.

Finally, I think the amount of work that I had perceived we needed to do is actually lower than when we didn't know what was happening, that during semester 1 while it was very useful I don't think we actually had any idea on how to finish what needed to be done.
